# captcha-solver
A solution for tackling captcha when collecting data from Amazon.

Inspired from - [Break a captcha system](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/how-to-break-a-captcha-system-in-15-minutes-with-machine-learning-dbebb035a710), and then added some of my own modifications and addtions to it.


The goal is to solve the captcha images from Amazon. Sample captcha image can be seen below -

The current model file is built after training some 4K training set captcha images.
Training can performed on much more larger dataset for better results, but current results aren't bad either :sweat_smile:.
